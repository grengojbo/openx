== Step by step installation process ==
 1. Download Canoo (http://webtest.canoo.com/webtest/manual/Downloads.html) and extract it into /usr/local/canoo folder
 2. Follow installation instruction (http://webtest.canoo.com/webtest/manual/install.html)
 3. If you are gonna to run tests remotely on EC2 machine copy "properties/user.properties.example" to "properties/user.remote.properties" and modify EC2 database access passwords
 4. If you are gonna to run tests locally copy "properties/user.properties.example" to "properties/user.local.properties" and modify local database access passwords
 5. Copy "properties/ec2.properties.example" to "properties/ec2.properties" and if you are gonnad to run tests remotely modify user access passwords
 6. Copy "lib/ant-contrib-1.0b3.jar", "lib/ant-jsch.jar" and "lib/jsch-0.1.33.jar" into both "/usr/local/ant/lib" and "/usr/local/canoo/lib" folders (assuming it is the location where you installed Ant and Canoo)
 7. Synopsis to run all tests (from within main folder):
 {{{
 # ant test-canoo
 }}}
 8. To run all tests locally (make sure you configured properly user.local.properties) run tests using remote=false switch:
 {{{
 # ant run-test-canoo -Drun.local=true
 }}}
 9. To run only a choosen test locally (where delivery/lg is a usecase we want to execute):
 {{{
 # ant test-canoo-one -Drun.local=true -Duc=delivery/lg
 }}}
