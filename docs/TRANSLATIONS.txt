Translating OpenX into your language
------------------------------------------------

This is a brief guide on how to translate OpenX into your own
language.



Locate the translation files
----------------------------

The first step is to locate all of the necessary language files. The basis
of your translation should be the English files. The main translations files
for the user interface can be found in:

  /lib/max/language/english/

However, you will also find translations in the "_lang" directories of some
plugins. For example:

  /plugins/3rdPartyServers/atlas/_lang/english.php
  /plugins/3rdPartyServers/bluestreak/_lang/english.php
  /plugins/3rdPartyServers/doubleclick/_lang/english.php
  /plugins/3rdPartyServers/eyeblaster/_lang/english.php
  /plugins/3rdPartyServers/falk/_lang/english.php
  /plugins/3rdPartyServers/max/_lang/english.php
  /plugins/3rdPartyServers/mediaplex/_lang/english.php
  /plugins/3rdPartyServers/tangozebra/_lang/english.php

  /plugins/invocationTags/_lang/english.php
  /plugins/invocationTags/adframe/_lang/english.php
  /plugins/invocationTags/adlayer/_lang/english.php
  /plugins/invocationTags/adview/_lang/english.php
  /plugins/invocationTags/adviewnocookies/_lang/english.php
  /plugins/invocationTags/clickonly/_lang/english.php
  /plugins/invocationTags/local/_lang/english.php
  /plugins/invocationTags/popup/_lang/english.php
  /plugins/invocationTags/publisherJs/_lang/english.php
  /plugins/invocationTags/xmlrpc/_lang/english.php

  /plugins/reports/admin/_lang/english.php
  /plugins/reports/advertiser/_lang/english.php
  /plugins/reports/agency/_lang/english.php
  /plugins/reports/publisher/_lang/english.php

This list may not be up to date, so please check all of the plugins
directories for translation files.



Translate the files in /lib/max/language/
-----------------------------------------

Once you have located all of the English language files, look in
/lib/max/language/ to see if your language is already supported. A number of
languages already have rudimentary translations. Most of these have been
taken are from phpAdsNew and are now outdated, but they will serve as a good
starting point for your own translations. Compare the files with the English
translation files in the directory to see what is missing.

Do not rename the files. That is:

  /lib/max/language/english/default.lang.php

will become

  /lib/max/language/YOUR_LANGUAGE/default.lang.php

where YOUR_LANGUAGE will be "german", "french", "italian"... whatever
the language is you are creating a translation for.

Remember, the language files in /lib/max/language/YOUR_LANGUAGE/ need to have
the same file name as those in the /lib/max/language/english/ directory.

If there is no directory for your language, simply create it, put in the
required translations files with the new translations, and OpenX should
automatically recognise your new language.



Translate the files in the plugins directory
--------------------------------------------

To create or update the translation files in the /plugins directory, the
approach is slightly different. Locate the _lang directory for the plugin you
wish to translate, and and ensure that the language file for your language is
up to date, based on the english.php file in that directory.

Unlike the language files in /lib/max/language/, all of the plugin translations
are kept in the same _lang directory for a plugin, while the filename is used
to differentiate languages.

For example, you were creating a new German translation for a plugin, you woult
copy the english.php file in that plugin's _lang directory to the file
german.php, and then update the new file with the German translations. Ensure
that the name of the language file for the plugin is the same as the directory
name in /lib/max/language/ for your language!



Testing translations
--------------------

Once you have updated the translation file(s), and ensured that they are upload
to your OpenX installation, check that you have set your native language as the
default language for OpenX in the settings. You should see the new translations
immediately after reloading the relevant page(s).



Submitting translations
-----------------------

Please send us your translations, so we can include them in the next release!

Thanks!
