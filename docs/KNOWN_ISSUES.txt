Please see http://trac.openx.org/ for the latest known bugs. The following
is a list of the major features that aren't in Openads, as opposed to bugs that
have been found.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

- Preferences don't cascade.

  (If the admin user sets preferences, and then creates an agency, the
  agency gets the admin user's preferences. However, if the admin user
  then changes preferences, and the agency has not set their own
  preference, they agency should get the new admin preference. They
  dont.)

- The version of PEAR::Config used in OpenX has been patched, but the
  patch has not yet been accepted by the maintainers yet. As a result,
  the version of PEAR::Config should not be updated.

- The version of PEAR::Cache_Lite used in OpenX has been patched, but the
  patch has not yet been accepted by the maintainers yet. As a result,
  the version of PEAR::Cache_Lite should not be updated.

- The version of PEAR::DB used in OpenX has been patched, but the
  patch has not yet been accepted by the maintainers yet. As a result,
  updates to PEAR::DB could be unstable, although the issue has only
  been replicated in a development environment.

- The version of PEAR::Date used in OpenX has been patched. See
  http://pear.php.net/bugs/bug.php?id=2338.

- The test suite won't completely work in PHP 5, due to the way mock
  objects work in Simpltest.
