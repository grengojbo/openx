    <h2>OpenX Market</h2>

    <p><strong>OpenX Market</strong> is a place where publishers can sell advertising space to advertisers.
        By making your inventory available to OpenX Market, you give advertisers a chance to bid directly to show their ads on your site.
        Here's what this means for you:

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Higher CPMs</strong>: Because advertisers bid on an impression-by-impression basis, we match your inventory with the highest paying advertisers every time.</li>
            <li><strong>Risk-free</strong>: You set a floor price for that inventory â€“ OpenX Market will only serve ads on your site if they pay better than your existing advertisers.  If they don't, you'll make as much money as if you didn't try OpenX Market.</li>
            <li><strong>Control</strong>: You can enable/disable OpenX Market on a campaign-by-campaign basis.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Get Started!</h3>
    
    <p>To get started, you need to create OpenX market account using your existing OpenX account. If you do not have OpenX account yet, you'll need to create one.</p>
