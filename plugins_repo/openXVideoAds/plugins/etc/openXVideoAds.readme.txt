README
=================
1 - Data Generator: please use the basic data generator in "/openx/www/admin/plugins/vastReport/stats-api.php" at line 6 & 7 and you will find:
	$vastReport->generateFakeVastStatistics($pastDays = 10, $bannerid = 1, $zoneid = 1);
2 - Data checks: Calling the API for all entities and all combination of "View As" ; look and set $outputAllCallGetStatistics to true in  "/openx/www/admin/plugins/vastReport/stats-api.php" 

Note that for both tools you just have to go to stats-vast.php page and this will trigger these tools.

What is supposed to work:
=================
- top graph showing 5 events for the total of the selected period
- date picker 
- menus are showing only for the right advertisers, campaigns and banners (when they contain some "video" banners)
- Show as table / graph % / graph count
- View by day / week / month / year / hour of day works
- View by campaign also works on advertiser report
- View by banner also works on advertiser + campaign reports
- CSV export (doesnt' support expanded row)
- when there is no data for a given date period, a row with values "0" will be shown, rather than not showing this period at all
- when there is no data for the selected daterange, print special message
- rows are often expandable: dates expand to campaign or banner, campaigns extend to banners (advertiser report only), dates don't expand on banner report, banner never expand
- only one expandable row at a time, row are collapsed when clicked on the icon again
- all campaign and banner names link to the Video Report for this campaign/banner
- added menu for the list of Video Plugins and loading iframe from staging
- load staging iframe when production set to 0, load iframe from website in prod 
- menus showing for websites and zones all the time (see TODO below)

Not done at this stage, TODO before release
=================
- check that the Players page links to the right link on the flowplayer website
- Add Maintenance in the plugin
- CODE: refactor & cleanup code in reporting & factor out the menu detection code from the stats-api & remove test / date generation code from the global space
- the website and zone tab in the Stats section should only show up for video zones and websites linked to at least one video zone
- add the "Help" linking to http://www.openx.org/en/docs/2.8/userguide/video+event+statistics
- Change plugin description, name, change this README
- Add checks for credentials when accessing screens
- Check for XSS and sql injection
- Full code review

Feature requests
=================
- add name of the reported item in the stats page, eg. "Advertiser Video Report for [advertiser name]"; Note that this usability issue is also true for all existing reports in OXP
- for website report, add "View by" for zones
- for zone report, add "View by" for campaigns and banners
- add a "Expand all"
