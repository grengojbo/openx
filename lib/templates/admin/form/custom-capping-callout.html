        Frequency capping depends on the ability to set user cookies. If you deselect this option, only users with cookies, and those meeting the capping limits provided, will be exposed to ads from this campaign. Selecting this option will allow for serving of ads to users before we know they accept cookies (such as on the first applicable page view), and also allow for unlimited exposure to very small number of users that do not accept cookies.
