Installing
==========

Complete details of how to install OpenX can be found at
http://docs.openx.org/. You should check this site for the latest
available details on how to install. However, for convenience, the install
process is essentially:

1) Make sure your database is correctly installed and running, and that
   your web server is setup with PHP and the appropriate database driver
   for PHP is installed.

   OpenX supports:
     - PHP        >= 4.3.11
     - MySQL      >= 4.0.18

   If you would like to have support for displaying graphs in the Openads
   statistics pages, you will also need to make sure that PHP is installed
   with support for GD.

2) Optional: Create a new database for your OpenX installation to use.

   While the OpenX installation wizard can create a database for you, this
   requires that the database user OpenX uses will require the ability to
   create databases.

   If you would prefer OpenX to use a database user with more restricted
   permission levels, create the database by hand, and set up a database user
   with permissions restricted to this database. See the complete installation
   documentation at http://docs.openx.org/ for details on the required
   database permissions needed by Openads.

3) Unpack the OpenX download into the directory on your web server where
   you would like to install openads.

4) Use a web browser to vist this directory, and follow the instructions
   in the installation wizard to complete the installation.

5) Use cron (or equivalent) to run the scripts/maintenance/maintenance.php
   script, with the domain of your site as a parameter, every hour, eg:

   0 * * * * /usr/local/bin/php -q
       /var/www/html/openx/scripts/maintenance/maintenance.php www.example.com
